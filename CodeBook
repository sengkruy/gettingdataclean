##Project Description

This project is to collect data and prepare a tidy data set for later analysis from the experiment data of human activity recognition using smartphones data set. More information about the experiments can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

##Raw Data Collection

The data for this project is available at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The folder includes the following data sets that are being used:
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt' and 'test/subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample for training and test set respectively. Its range is from 1 to 30.

## Data Processing

1.	Load feature name from 'features.txt' and filter out only the features which contain words 'mean' or 'std' and assign to 'filter_feature'
2. 	Load 'X_train.txt' and 'X_test.txt' data with only columns specify in filter_feature
3. 	Load 'y_train.txt', 'y_test.txt', 'subject_train.txt', 'subject_test.txt' into train_y, test_y, train_subj and test_subj respectively
4.	Combine data by column using cbind() function. Data needed to combine are test_subj,test_y,test_x for test set and train_subj,train_y,train_x for training set
5. 	Combine training and test set together using rbind() function and assign to data
6.	Clean up feature name by replacing '-' to '_' and remove '()' using gsub function
7. 	Replace column names of data with new feature columns in step 6
8.	Load 'activity_labes.txt' and assign to activity_name
9. 	Map the activity name from activity_name to column 'activity' in data
10. Aggregate data by 'subject' and 'activity' and compute the mean for each feature and assign to new_data
11. Save new_data to file txt using write.table() function


## Descriptions of new variables

activity_name: real activity name of label
features: list of all features
filter_feature: feactures containing mean (‘mean’)and standard deviation(‘std’)
train_x: training set
train_y: training labels
train_subj: each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample for training set
test_x: test set
test_y: test labels
test_subj: each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample for test set
train: training set together with subject and activity
test: test set together with subject and activity
ddata: merged data set including both train and test
new_data: summary data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
